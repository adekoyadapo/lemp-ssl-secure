## LEMP SERVER WITH SELF SIGNED CERTIFICATE

A Simple 3 Tier application server running PHP-7-FPM, NGINX and MYSQL with dummy dataset created on build with docker-composer

### Prerequisites

Deployment puts into consideration that a VM is runnig the latest verions of docker, docker-compose and git

For information on setting up a docker environment on any platform visit; [LEMP-ssl](https://github.com/adekoyadapo/LEMP-ssl.git)

Also [Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for various distro installation

For this build it will be setup on a Google Compute Engine with a start up script deploying and fetching the repository

This install assumes you have a running VM in which ever environment with all requirements installed.

For standalone environments like running in on a local machine with temporary certificates visit

### Requirement for GCP environment

Dependencies includes Git Wget docker docker-compose
Ensure selinux is set to disabled or permissive
The startup script below will ensure dependencies are met for a Centos 7 VM and the repository is pulled and installed in the home directory of the cloud user

You have an already verified domain name with access to nameserver records and create A records and cname.

Visit [Google WebMAster](https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/home) for information on the verification process. The best process might be to use a TXT record setup in CloudDNS

As this install is for GCP, when creating a VM ensure you enable PTR on the nic

Visit [GCP PTR Record](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-ptr-record)


For Centos 7 VM Start-up script can be
```
#/bin/bash
yum clean all && yum update -y && yum install docker git wget bind-utils -y
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo sed -i 's/enforcing/disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config /etc/selinux/config
sudo sestatus
chkconfig docker on
service docker start
`dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com` | grep name > hostPubIP.txt

git clone https://github.com/adekoyadapo/lemp-ssl-secure.git
```

### Setup and deploy

SSH into the machine using the cloud shell by clicking on the SSH by the instance IP and copying the cloudshell command or start in cloudshell

```
gcloud compute --project "synopsys-k8s" ssh --zone "us-east1-b" "instance-1"
```
Ensure you become root and change directory to the downloaded folder

```
sudo -s && cd lemp-ssl-secure
```
Incase the folder is not avalable run the command below

```
git clone https://github.com/adekoyadapo/lemp-ssl-secure.git
```

You will need to edit 2 files
First the certificate request script. "init-lemp-ssl.sh"
Edit and change the domains and email section, you might want to set the staging to 1 for test purposes to avoid request limits.
Next edit the default.conf file and change the server_name in the file from localhost to your registered and verified domain name.

Then run the script to initialize the build

```
./init-ssl-secure.git
```
## Deployment

Simply run the command below
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```
